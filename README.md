# Combine-ER-Reports

Purpose: Combine weekend ER reports to save time and potential manual copy/paste mistakes

## Why Important

After weekends, we work the reports that were run on the weekend as well as current day. 

It is time and focus consuming and something we need to do on a regular basis (usually every Monday)

Time saved per Monday not manually combining 30+ files is around 20 minutes.

It also leaves lots of room for manual copy/paste errors, accidently skipping files etc

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install respective libraries.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install glob
pip install openpyxl
```

## Contributing

I was helped immensely by https://github.com/Fehiroh who walked me through the logic and thought process of the script (originally done in R/tidyverse). I then re-worked the script into Python/Pandas using the same logic.
